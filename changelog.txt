NoPSN-Downloader is a small XMB Add-on which lists and lets you download NoPSN Apps (made & hosted by @esc0rtd3w)
from the XMB.

OFW/CFW compatible:

-OFW: it uses the first add-on default slot. Just install the PKG and it should appear on the XMB.
-CFW: you will need to modify your category_game.xml file and add these lines:

			<Query
				 class="type:x-xmb/folder-pixmap"
				 key="han_xmb_addon1"
				 src="xmb://localhost/dev_hdd0/game/HANXMBA01/USRDIR/han_xmb_addon1.xml#han_xmb_addon1_main"
				 />
				 
then you can install the PKG.
